my name is Tomas Scerbak from Slovakia aka [DevTom](https://github.com/TomasScerbak) and I'm Project Manager :see_no_evil: by the day and Front-end developer by the night. I work in IT environment for almost 13 years and decided to make a career change as I always missed creativity aspect of my current job. I decided to take front-end path and as soon as I landed my hands on keyboard and wrote first code I love it! Currently I'm learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and in the near future hopefully I will start with some of the libraries / frameworks.

Skills and Experience:
